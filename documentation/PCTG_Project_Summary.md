# PCTG Project Summary

## Final Status: COMPLETE ‚úÖ

Successfully created a single, optimized PCTG filament profile for the Prusa Core One 3D printer.

## Final Files

### Core Profile

- **`Extrudr_PCTG_Core_One_v2_organized.ini`** - The definitive PCTG profile
  - Comprehensive documentation with section headers
  - PrusaSlicer-compatible (no inline comments)
  - Production-ready with educational value
  - Based on proven Bambu Labs settings

### Documentation

- **`PCTG_Profile_Testing_Guide.md`** - Complete testing and import instructions
- **`PCTG_Profile_Optimizations.md`** - Technical details of optimizations applied

## Key Achievements

### üéØ **Seam Hiding Optimizations**

- Enhanced wipe before retraction (30%)
- Layer change retraction enabled
- Optimized Z-hop settings (0.15mm)

### üåâ **Bridge Quality Improvements**

- Increased bridge fan speed to 70%
- Balanced cooling for PCTG material properties

### ‚è±Ô∏è **Layer Time Optimization**

- Reduced slowdown threshold to 8 seconds
- Smart fan control (no fan for first 3 layers)

### üîß **Bambu Labs Proven Settings**

- Temperature: 268¬∞C nozzle, 260¬∞C first layer, 80¬∞C bed
- Pressure advance: 0.03 via start G-code (increased for better precision)
- Retraction: 0.8mm @ 35mm/s with 25mm/s deretract

## Ready for Production

The profile is now ready for:

1. ‚úÖ Import into PrusaSlicer
2. ‚úÖ Production printing
3. ‚úÖ Learning and customization
4. ‚úÖ Quality validation testing

## Clean Workspace

- Removed duplicate profile variants
- Kept only the comprehensive organized version
- Updated all documentation to reflect single-profile approach
- Maintained all optimization benefits
