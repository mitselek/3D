# Markdown Linting Script for 3D Printing Workspace
# Checks all .md files for common markdown formatting issues
#
# DEVELOPMENT PLAN (June 4, 2025):
# - Improve this linting script gradually as new errors get encountered
# - When VS Code PROBLEMS tab shows markdown issues:
#   1. Run this script first - if it reports errors, fix them
#   2. If this script shows no errors but VS Code does, enhance this script
#   3. If terminal output fails, report "eyesight struggle" and ask for help
# - Add new checks immediately when encountered
# - Collect false positives and deal with them as they appear
# - Track weird edge cases in comments below
#
# CURRENT MARKDOWN RULES CHECKED:
# - MD040: Fenced code blocks without language specification (```$)
# - MD012: Multiple consecutive blank lines (3+ blank lines in a row)
# - MD022: Headings should be surrounded by blank lines (respects code fence boundaries)
# - CUSTOM: Malformed code block closing fences (```language instead of ```)
#
# KNOWN EDGE CASES:
# - Malformed code block: ```text closing fence instead of ``` (IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ)
#   Successfully detects lines like "```ini" when they should be just "```"
# - Trailing blank lines: Files ending with extra blank lines (IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ)
#   Quick fix: sed -i -e :a -e '/^\s*$/N;ba' -e 's/\n*$//' filename.md
#
# FALSE POSITIVES ENCOUNTERED:
# - Fixed: MD040 incorrectly flagged closing fences (```) as missing language spec
# - Fixed: Malformed fence detection incorrectly flagged opening fences (```language) as malformed closing fences
# - Fixed: MD022 incorrectly analyzed content inside code fences (now respects fence boundaries)
#
# NOT YET IMPLEMENTED (common VS Code markdown rules):
# - MD032: Lists should be surrounded by blank lines  
# - MD031: Fenced code blocks should be surrounded by blank lines
# - MD025: Multiple top-level headings
# - MD041: First line should be a top-level heading
#
# USEFUL FIXES FOR DETECTED ISSUES:
# - To remove trailing blank lines: sed -i -e :a -e '/^\s*$/N; s/\n$//; ta' filename.md
#   (This removes all trailing blank lines in one command)
